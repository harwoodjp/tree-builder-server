## Packages

This is a custom Express project structure with a React front end. 

It uses the following: 
* `webpack` with `babel` for bundling
* `dotenv` for environmental variables
* `lodash` as templating engine
* `knex`, a lightweight query builder
* `react`, `react-router`, `react-helmet`, `styled-components`

## .env 

This project uses `dotenv` to simulate environmental variables. These variables specify a port for the server and database credentials.

Your `.env` file, created in the project root, should be structured as follows:

```
PORT=
DB_HOST=
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
```
